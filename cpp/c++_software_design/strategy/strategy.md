# The Strategy Design Pattern

## Analysis

- With the Strategy design pattern, we have identified the ___implementation details of a single function___ as a ___variation point___. After introducing an abstraction for these implementation details, weâ€™re still able to easily add new types, but we are not able to easily add new operations. Adding an operation would still require you to intrusively add a virtual member function.
- Visitor and Strategy cannot be applied together for runtime polymorphism.
- __Composition__: by using HAS-A relation, we avoid exponential growth of inheritance hierarchy and allows us to confugure behavior from the outside (dependency injection)

- __Shortcomings__:
    - in runtime polymorphism, it incurs performance cost with additional runtime dispatch
    - multiple Strategy objects needed for multiple operations, otherwise (one strategy for multiple operations) will violate SRP

## Classic Implementation

- use template base class for the Strategy abstraction so that `Circle` does not know about other shapes

## Value Semantics using `std::function`

- __pros__: all the strengths of value semantics over reference semantics
- __cons__:
    - potential performance disadvantage if relying on the standard implementation
    - only supports one operation, if need `undo` like in Command design pattern, need another instance

## Strategy in static polymorphism (Policy-Based Design)

```cpp
template <DrawCircleStrategyConcept DrawCircleStrategy>
class Circle : public Shape {
    /*...*/
    DrawCircleStrategy drawer_;
};
```

- __pros__:
    - do not need base class `DrawStrategy<T>` anymore
    - better performance with no pointer indirections and runtime dispatch
- __cons__
    - lose the flexibility to configure at runtime
    - since it becomes template, it is defined in header file, without C++20 modules, this creates physical dependency on implementation of `Circle`

# Command Design Pattern

## Analysis

- Strategy vs Command
    - structurally identical to Strategy and has the same strengths and shortcomings
    - only difference is that the Strategy design pattern specifies ___how___ something should be done, the Command design pattern specifies ___what___ should be done.
    - if there is an `undo()` operation, it means it's focused on ___what___ should be done and has the information to roll back the operation, so it is Command
    - there is a gray area between them
    - example:
        - Strategy: STL container allocator, comparator in `std::sort`
        - Command: thread pool tasks, UnaryFunc in `std::for_each`
